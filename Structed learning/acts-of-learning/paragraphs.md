# 段---how to rewrite

## Every paragraph in a paper should be-----启下

### Unified 
All of the sentences in a single paragraph should be related to a single controlling idea(often expressed in the topic sentence of the paragraph).

### Clearly related to the thesis 
The sentences should all refer to the central idea, or thesis, of the paper.
对于主旨来说，可能是对topic的讨论---人的理性---Logic tree\ Argumentation，可能就是一些 assumption---历史的记叙


### Coherent
The sentences should be arranged in a logical manner and should follow a definite plan for development.


### Well-developed
Every idea discussed in the paragraph should be adequately explained and supported through evidence and details that work together to explain the paragraph's controlling idea.

### [Thesis statement](https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/thesis-statements/)
1. tells the reader **how you will interpret the significance of the subject matter** under discussion.
2. is **a road map for the paper** ; in other words, it tells the reader what to expect from the rest of the paper.
3. directly **answers the question asked of you**. A thesis is an interpretation of a question or subject, not the subject itself. The subject, or topic, of an essay might be World War II or Moby Dick; a thesis must then offer a way to understand the war or the novel.
4. makes a claim that others might dispute.
5. is usually a single sentence near the beginning of your paper (most often, at the end of the first paragraph) that **presents your argument** to the reader. The rest of the paper, the body of the essay, gathers and organizes evidence that will persuade the reader of the logic of your interpretation.
