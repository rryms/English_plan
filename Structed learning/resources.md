### How to use
* When you look up a word, put a $\checkmark$ next to it. Each time you return to a page with a $\checkmark$ look at it quickly to chech that you remember the word.
* If you see an English word in a text, first try ro guess the meaning, and carry on reading to see if your guess seems correct. Use your dictionary to check the meaning.
* If you look up a word in a bilingual dictionary and get several different words in your own language, look up the word in your monolingual dictionary. This should help you to decide which word in your own language is the nearest translation in this context.
* Remember that many words have more than one meaning, and the first meaning in the dictionary is not always the one you want. Read through the different meanings.
